# 2021java-HomestuckUtilities
A variety of single-serving jars full of handy procedural bits and bobs.

Each subfolder is for a different utility, and should contain some sourcecode and a .jar that you should be able to run.

Changelog:

2022-11-16 :: -06:45- V0.2.1 (no jar) Added to-do lists to troll.husk.body, moved grubscars to pupation gene, moved skin coverings to feral gene and adjusted phrasings, added when stance goes from quad -> biped to pupation gene

2022-11-11 :: -11:45- V0.2 uploaded.  Updated Troll.husk.gene to get Permute working, updated troll.husk.body to correct a typo in the documentation at the top for fingene, updated troll.fluff.desc to actually provide descriptions and have those descriptions work.  Numerous small errors corrected.  Added a desc entry to the main Troll class so it gets saved along with everything else.  Desc now provides working descriptions of troll.body.build, troll.body.respiratorygene, and troll.body.fingene.  I'm looking at pupations, skin, and feral traits next.

2022-11-10 :: -05:39-  Updated elements, tags, some of the documentation in the horn section.  I might have unsaved progress but it's on a machine that's currently inaccessible, I'll incorporate those again when I can.  I'm not sure where exactly "titles" are, might redo that one.  I know it exists somewhere..

2021-06-23 :: -00:24-  Added titles, and Amici and Chibi's suggestions for word additions.  

2021-06-22 :: -13:20-  Added folder for Names-Tags-Titles.  Press a button, it generates a few names with trolltags.  Titles to be added.
