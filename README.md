# 2021java-HomestuckUtilities
A variety of single-serving jars full of handy procedural bits and bobs.

Each subfolder is for a different utility, and should contain some sourcecode and a .jar that you should be able to run.

Changelog:

2022-11-10 :: -05:39-  Updated elements, tags, some of the documentation in the horn section.  I might have unsaved progress but it's on a machine that's currently inaccessible, I'll incorporate those again when I can.  I'm not sure where exactly "titles" are, might redo that one.  I know it exists somewhere..

2021-06-23 :: -00:24-  Added titles, and Amici and Chibi's suggestions for word additions.  

2021-06-22 :: -13:20-  Added folder for Names-Tags-Titles.  Press a button, it generates a few names with trolltags.  Titles to be added.
